## Demo Video Link - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1h5ycY5B-u9mjNPssmp-RK0dBbAYUjt-N/view

## Brief Description of the Idea

- Nowadays due to the increased use of technology and smart gadgets, adults and children are developing various brain disorders like anxiety and depression which (EEG) ElectroEncephaloGram signal detects.
- EEG signal test describes the electrical activity of the brain. Neurologists, use these test results, to describe the type of brain disorder an individual is having for further diagnosis.
- To deal with high-cost consultation, our team has developed an Android application ‘NeuroCortex’ which classifies brain signals to detect the type of brain disorder at a very low cost.
